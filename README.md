Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

---Software engineering is an aspect of engineering that invovles designing,developing,testing and maintaining software programs that are important in the technology industry.

---For example,web applications(facebook),mobile apps(instagram) and so on.  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

---1.Development of programming languages: This enhaced the performance of software engineering by the optimization in language design and compilation,leading to faster execution and better resource utilization.

---2.The establishment of software engineering as a discipline:The need for the establishment arose due to the innovations of high-level programming languages,structured programming,software development methodologies and so on.

---3.The advent of structured programming:
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

---1. Requirements.

---2. Design.

---3. Implementation.

---4. Testing.

---5. Deployment.

---6. Maintenance.

---1.Requirement: This incudes the proces of collecting data from user's needs and the system reuirements to carry on the software development.

---2.Design: The process of creating high-level designs of how the software programs will look like.

---3.Implementation: Writing codes and building the software upon the design. 

---4.Testing:This involves checking if the implemented software meets the requirement of the user needs,could be done on simulation or android devices.

---5.Deployment:This involves sending out the software products to the target audience.

---6.Maintenance:The products require maintenance to make them continue functioning well.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.




Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
